			<div id="panel1" class="content">
				Open Hand is a place where the working poor, and those on fixed incomes, can come for food and solace. 
				Every volunteer is there because thatâ€™s where they believe God wants them to be.</br>
				</br>
				Open Hand is entirely dependent on the Biblical God for provision. 
				We don't get our food from the Utah Food Bank or any other government entity. 
				We primarily purchase the food with money God has provided, although we also accept and give away non-expired food that has been donated. 
				We buy the food locally.</br>
				</br>
				Open Hand is not a program for the homeless; there are great Rescue Missions better equipped to assist them.
				We assist those that just can't make it without food help, the working poor, those on fixed incomes, those that are struggling to feed their children and/or themselves.</br>
				</br>
				We exist for one reason only: to help those in need with the love and compassion of the Biblical Jesus, and to show them that He loves them, too.
