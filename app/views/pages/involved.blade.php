					You can <b>pray</b> for Open Hand. 
					Pray for Open Hand to be pleasing in God's sight; that many would come to know Him and His provision through Open Hand. 
				</li>
				<li>
					If you agree to the belief structure of Open Hand (<a href="#">Statement of Faith</a>) and you feel called to serve, <b>become a volunteer</b>!
					We would love to serve with you.
					There are plenty of "behind the scenes" jobs that anyone can do, but if you interact with the public you will be required to read and sign the <a href="#">Statement of Faith</a>.
					Volunteering at Open Hand is for those that <i>want to serve</i>; not to repay an obligation for community service hours.
				</li>
				<li>
