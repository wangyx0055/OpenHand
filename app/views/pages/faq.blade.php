					<div id="panel1" class="content">
						Firstly, Open Hand is a ministry serving the Body of Christ by giving food, comforat, and support during difficult times-reminding them of the great love God has for them.</br>
						Secondly, Open Hand serves those in need within the community.
						Volunteers serve with Christ's love and build relationships where the love, salvation, and provision of the Biblical Jesus can be clearly seen.
						Our sole purpose is to please God by creaing an atmosphere where relationships can be built, needs are met, and those coming for food feel the love of Christ when they walk through the door.</br>
						We do this through providing food.</br>

				<li class="accordion-navigation">
					<a href="#panel2">When and where do we distribute?</a>
					<div id="panel2" class="content">

						Hours are from 10 am to 1 pm; the doors close at 12:45 pm.</br>

					<a href="#panel3">What does it cost to run Open Hand?</a>
					<div id="panel3" class="content">
						Depending on the time of year, an average month can be between $8,000 and $20,000+. 
						If a family chose every item offered (which is usually the case), the cost of food per family for 1 week is approximately $32.00 (this will vary slightly depending on sales and price fluctuations).</br>
						</br>
						*<i>We do not get the food from the Utah food bank or the government. 
						Open Hand purchases the food locally and depends solely upon God to provide, and He always does. 
						This is an expensive ministry (in our human eyes), but we have never been left wanting. Ever. He is a loving, awesome provider for all to see!</i></br>

				<li class="accordion-navigation">
					<a href="#panel4">How many people are served?</a>
					<div id="panel4" class="content">
						Depending on the time of year, an average Saturday could see between 150 and 250 families come through for food in a 3 hour period. 
						A typical Saturday could bring as many as 1000 people needing food and other help- all needing to see (or be reminded of) Christâ€™s love and provision.</br>

					<a href="#panel5">What does a volunteer day look like?</a>
					<div id="panel5" class="content">
						A typical distribution day will start with volunteers arriving to set up at 8:30 am, devotion and communion at 9, with doors opening to the public at 10.
						Around 12:45 we start cleaning (as able depending on how busy we are) and are usually through with clean up and have left by 1:30 pm.</br>
						</br>
						Food pallet unloading (to restock) is generally done on the Friday evening between the 2 monthly distributions and takes about 2 hours.
						For those inclined to, pallet unloading is followed by corporate prayer time where we pray for those that come to Open Hand and for the ministry.
						Even with prayer time, the evening is usually complete by 9 pm.</br>
